# Misty Simon Says Game

A classic Simon Says game for the Misty II robot! Misty will give you commands like "Simon says touch my head" or just "Touch my chin". You should only follow commands that start with "Simon says"!

## How It Works

1. **Misty says "Let's play Simon Says!"** and explains the rules
2. **Misty gives commands** like "Simon says touch my head front" or "Touch my chin"
3. **Follow ONLY if she says "Simon says"** - if she doesn't, DON'T touch!
4. **If you touch when she doesn't say "Simon says"** - YOU LOSE! 
5. **Get 5 successful commands to WIN the game!**

## Features

- üëÜ **Touch Sensors**: Uses Misty's capacitive touch sensors
- ü§ñ **Visual Feedback**: LED colors change based on game state
- üó£Ô∏è **Voice Commands**: Misty speaks all commands clearly
- üéØ **Classic Rules**: Only follow commands with "Simon says"
- üéâ **Win Celebration**: Special animation when you get 5 correct!
- üé≠ **Expressive**: Misty shows emotions through her screen
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Timeout System**: 5 seconds to respond to each command
- üé≤ **Random Commands**: Variety of touch sensor commands

## Prerequisites

1. **Misty II Robot** - Connected to your WiFi network
2. **Python 3.8+** installed on your computer
3. **Misty Python SDK** - Download from [MistyCommunity/Python-SDK](https://github.com/MistyCommunity/Python-SDK)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download Misty Python SDK

1. Download the Misty Python SDK from: https://github.com/MistyCommunity/Python-SDK
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\MistySDK`)

### Step 2: Place Your Project

Copy the `misty-simon-says` folder into the same directory as the Misty SDK so your structure looks like:

```
MistySDK/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mistyPy/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Robot.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Events.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EventFilters.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GenerateRobot.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ misty-simon-says/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ misty_simon_says.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Open a terminal/command prompt in the SDK directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r misty-simon-says/requirements.txt
```

Or install individually:
```bash
pip install requests>=2.25.1
pip install websocket-client<=0.57.0
pip install yapf>=0.30.0
```

### Step 4: Update Robot Commands (First Time Only)

Create a file called `update.py` in the SDK directory with:

```python
from mistyPy.GenerateRobot import RobotGenerator
RobotGenerator("YOUR_MISTY_IP_ADDRESS")
```

Run it once:
```bash
python update.py
```

This updates the SDK with your robot's available commands.

### Step 5: Find Your Misty's IP Address

1. Open the **Misty App** on your phone
2. Connect to your Misty
3. Look for the IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

## Running the Game

1. Make sure Misty is powered on and connected to WiFi
2. Navigate to the misty-simon-says directory:
   ```bash
   cd misty-simon-says
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python misty_simon_says.py
   ```
4. Enter Misty's IP address when prompted
5. Follow the on-screen instructions!

## How to Play

1. **Listen Carefully**: Misty will give you a command
2. **Check for "Simon Says"**: Did she say "Simon says" before the command?
3. **Follow or Don't**: 
   - ‚úÖ If she said "Simon says" ‚Üí Touch the sensor she mentioned
   - ‚ùå If she didn't say "Simon says" ‚Üí DON'T touch anything!
4. **Win Condition**: Successfully complete 5 "Simon says" commands
5. **Lose Condition**: Touch a sensor when she didn't say "Simon says"

## Sensors Used

### Touch Sensors (Capacitive)
| Sensor ID | Location | Command Example |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| HeadFront | Front of head | "Simon says touch my head front" |
| HeadLeft  | Left side of head | "Touch my head left" |
| HeadRight | Right side of head | "Simon says touch my head right" |
| HeadBack  | Back of head | "Touch my head back" |
| Chin      | Under the head | "Simon says touch my chin" |
| Scruff    | Back of neck | "Touch my scruff" |

## Game Controls

- **Touch Sensors**: Use your finger to touch Misty's capacitive sensors
- **Quit Game**: Press `Ctrl+C` at any time

## LED Color Guide

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| White | Neutral/Ready |
| Yellow | Giving command |
| Cyan | Waiting for response |
| Green | Correct! |
| Orange | Wrong (missed command) |
| Red | Game Over (touched without "Simon says") |

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure Misty is powered on and connected to WiFi
- Verify you're using the correct IP address
- Check that your computer is on the same network as Misty

### Sensor Detection Issues
- Make sure you're touching the correct sensor that Misty mentions
- Touch sensors require skin contact (capacitive)
- Wait for the cyan LED (Misty is ready for input)

### Import Errors
- Make sure the `mistyPy` folder is in the parent directory
- Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that you've run the `update.py` script at least once

### Robot Not Responding
- Check network connection
- Try restarting Misty
- Verify the IP address is correct

## Code Structure

```
MistySimonSays
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__()            # Initialize game settings and sensor mappings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup_game()          # Prepare Misty and explain rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ touched_callback()    # Handle touch sensor events
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ give_command()        # Generate and speak a command
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wait_for_response()   # Wait for player to touch (or not)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ check_response()      # Verify if player was correct
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ play_game()           # Main game loop with event registration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handle_victory()      # Celebrate winning (5 correct)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handle_game_over()    # Handle losing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ end_game()            # Cleanup and reset Misty
```

## Game Logic

The game follows these rules:

1. **Command Types**:
   - 70% chance: "Simon says touch [sensor]" (player SHOULD touch)
   - 30% chance: "Touch [sensor]" (player should NOT touch)

2. **Success Conditions**:
   - "Simon says" + player touches correct sensor = SUCCESS ‚úì
   - No "Simon says" + player doesn't touch = SUCCESS ‚úì

3. **Failure Conditions**:
   - "Simon says" + player doesn't touch = MISTAKE (can continue)
   - No "Simon says" + player touches = GAME OVER ‚úó

4. **Win**: 5 successful commands
5. **Lose**: Touch when "Simon says" wasn't used
